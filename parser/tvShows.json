The series is based on the Witchblade comic book series, and followed a pilot film which debuted in August 2000. Some of the episodes were written by Ralph Hemecker, Marc Silvestri and J.D. Zeik.\n\nYancy Butler starred as Sara Pezzini, Anthony Cistaro as Kenneth Irons, David Chokachi as Jake McCartey, Eric Etebari as Ian Nottingham, Will Yun Lee as Danny Woo, Conrad Dunn as Tommy Gallo, Kenneth Welsh as Joe Siri, and John Hensley as Gabriel Bowman, among others. Although critically acclaimed and popular with audiences, the show was canceled in September 2002; there was speculation that the cancellation was connected to Butler's entering rehab for alcoholism.\n\nThe series ran for two seasons on TNT, for a total of 24 episodes. The first episode aired June 12, 2001; the last episode aired August 26, 2002. In spite of its cancellation, Witchblade was ranked seventh in the Top 10 Basic Cable Dramas for 2002.\n\nAccording to Top Cow editor Matt Hawkins the Witchblade TV series was cancelled because the lead actress Yancy Butler was an alcoholic and went into rehab – it was and remains the highest rated TV series to be cancelled.",

Created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin, it was first broadcast on 6 September 1986, and transmitted in the UK on BBC One. The original producer was Geraint Morris.\n\nThe programme is based around the fictional Holby City Hospital and focuses on the staff and patients of the hospital's Accident and Emergency Department. The show has very few ties to its sister programme Holby City which began as a spin off from Casualty in 1999 and is set in the same hospital, but upstairs. The show's plots and characters occasionally crossover between the two programmes, but this is rare, and each show can easily be followed without having to watch the other. Casualty is shown weekly on a Saturday evening, which has been its time slot since the early 1990s.",
